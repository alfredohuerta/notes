### Requirements analysis process

* 

* Analysis
    - Hear and study the stakeholders wants and needs to deliver the correct features to the customer.

* Specification
    - Figure out what will be part of our MVP
    - Select the important task and use effectively the time you have to implement them as code.

* Validation
    - Get the approval of the customer of the requirements selected, so the work in them can begin
    - Keep track of who said what and who approved the features.

* Management

### Potential Stakeholders

* Who will use the system

* Will manage the system

* Development team

* Process or development responsability

* FInancial Interest (customer/sales)

* Regulators

* Negatively affected actors

### Prioritizing  features
* Generate a MVP
    - Fatures
    - Identify the core problem
    - Set of users

* What can be delayed?

* Identify and understand the business requirements/needs

* Long-term goal of the company
    - Have a focus of what will be useful in the future
    - Aim to keep a longlasting project that will evolve with time

* Success criteria

* Identify opportunities

* Plan user journey

* Generate pain/ gain maps

### Select features to build
* Finilize features

* Product roadmap

* Prioritation Matrix (how will we compare and select in what work)

### Hidden requirements
Things that are not said or written that are critical to the development of the project, but can threaten the success of it. Can cause time and budget constrains. Are caused by failing to recognize the best practices of the development or lack of knowledge from the stakeholder, also by focusing to much in delivery, not in satisfiying the customer.

### How to avoid failure
* Process modeling -> Requirements analysis

* Make proper QA

* Time boxing a process or setting milestone days, days in which some part of the development will be finished.

* Coss industry analysis

* Engage users early in the process, not leave them 'till the final part.

* Keep in mind those Stakeholders external to the product

* Communication with everyone, good and eficient communication

* Code reviews.

# Notes

* How to communicate with the stakeholders?
    - Make videos, ask a lot of questions, shadow them, get to know their processes and where they fail
    - Ask for propper resources to work with
